## Day 1
## Theory - Fundamentals of VLSI Design and overview of Sand-to-Silicon

<details><summary> Overwiew of VLSI Design </summary>

### **Overview**
From system aprroach ( Ex. Motherboard ) --> Chip to Wafer (Ex Central of the chip called die (where all the fabricated components are inside)) --> Inside the die which containts all the components (Memory (RAM) ,Memory controller , Analog and RF(PLL,LDO,VCO .etc), Digital (decoder, register, fsm .etc ) seperate into each partition .

<details><summary> History of VLSI Design </summary>

###  History of VLSI Design 

From the evolution of single transistor --> Very Large Scale Integration (> 20,000 transistor ) --> System on Chip (SOC -Multiple IP ) --> System in Package (SiP - Heterogeneous Integration )

* **Moore's Law** - Number of trasistor in an integated Chip (IC) will doubles about every two years. Size will be reduce to $1/sqrt{2}$

</details>

<details><summary> VLSI Design Methodology  </summary>

### VLSI Design Style 

* **FPGA** - Field Proramming Gate Array Design 
* **ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit)** - Standard cell base Design & Full custom Design 

 * **Standard Cell Base Design** -  standard cell library component are used to make the design .
     Ex.  half adder to make full adder
 
 * **Full Custom Design** - Designers intend to design their  own design itself ( Ex. orientation and placement of trasistor in layout design ) 
 
**FPGA VS ASIC **

| | FGPA | ASIC | 
|---| ----| ---|
| Time to Manufacture |Faster time to market - no layout , masks and manufacturing steps needed | Need longer design times to take care of all manufacturing steps |
|Reusability |Field programmability - Design Changes can be absorbed even in filed and FPGA reprogrammed | Once manufactured, need to spin again a new chips in case of bugs |
|Power/Performance | More power consumption and less performance because of programmable design and low clock speed | Custom design for an application helps in designing for power/performance efficiencies | 
|Production | Good for prototyping and low volume designs, as cost would be less | For larger volume of production , cost per unit is much less for an ASIC | 
|Analog and Mixed Signal | Not Possible | Supported | 
 
 </details>

<details><summary> Package Technology  </summary>
 
 ### Package Technology
 
 Package is where the die chip is being hold . This package is very important because failure can happen if the packaging is not being done properly 
 Ex . factor that affect package Length of bonding wire,lead length of the package,number of ground and power and the bonding pads .

 ## Day 2
## Theory - Analog VLSI Design Flow and CMOS Fabrication Process

<details><summary> Analog VLSI Design Flow </summary> 
 
###  *Analog IC Design Process*
 
 The overview of the analog IC design Process can be seperated into 4 parts which is 
 + Electrical Design
 + Physical Design
 + Fabrication 
 + Testing and product Developement or Test Design 
 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/211248780-f30b3cd2-e2b2-4db8-905e-5ecf18487aee.png)
*Diagram above shows how each part is contributing to the Analog IC design Process .*
 
 | Electrical Design | Physical Design  | Test Design | 
|---| ----| ---|
 | Electrical design is the process of going from the specification to a circuit solution | Physical design is the process of representing the electrical design in a layout consisting blocks at various levels | Test design is the process of coordinating , planning and implementing the measurement of the analog integrated circuit performance |
 | Required active and passive device models for <ul><li>Creating the design</li><li>Verying the design</li><li>Determining the robustness of the design</li></ul>| Requires <ul><li>Entering various geometries</li><li>Check DRC </li><li>Check LVS</li><li>Extract Parasitic</li></ul> | Type of test <ul><li>Functional</li><li>Parametric</li><li>Static</li><li>Dynamic</li><ul>| 
 
 *Analog IC Design Process Defination*
 
 **Relationship Between Design Process with CAD and PDK**
 In each Analog IC Design process ,Computer Aided Design(CAD) and Process Design Kit(PDK) play a role important to complete such process .
 + CAD - Much like a software that helps in creation , modification , analaysis of a design . Ex. Magic , Spice 2 , Mentor graphics
 + Process Design Kit - Set of files or library to a model a farbrication process generated by the foundary . The purpose of it is to defined a certain technology varitation for the process. 
 
 </details>

  <details><summary> CMOS Fabrication Process </summary> 
   
  ###**Overview** 
   
   *Circuit Designer need to have deeper understanding of CMOS manufacturing process and the role as a circuit designer itself due to*  
   + Physical implementation has a major impact on performance, power and cost.
   + Not rely based on the ideal circuit , instead base on practical circuit that have many limitations and constraint .
   + So that less iterations of the design can be implemented .
   + A good designer always discussed with each other for better understanding and efficiencies . 
   
   Why Cmos Technology is widely used ? 
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/211256980-95c4ddf3-4ff5-402e-b17f-1eb34d87f599.png)

   Cmos Technology 
   + Submircron Technlogy (DSM) > 0.35um
   + Deep Submicron Technology (UDSM) : 0.1um < Lmin < 0.35um 
   + Ultra-Deep Submicron Technology Lmin < 0.1min
   + BiCMOS Technology Lmin = 0.5um 
                                                  
   Submicron an object which is smaller than a micron < 0.5um .

  **1.Wafer Formation** 
   
<img width="205" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/211259878-77ecb7ba-47ea-4a32-82f1-cca90eed0a5a.png">

   + Pure silicon is melted on a very high degreem temperature . 
   + A small seed containing the desired cyrstal is inserted into the molten silicon and slowly pull out . 
   
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/211262375-2c88ba43-a768-4408-b625-3d326ccbe44b.png)

   + The silicon being pulled will be manufactured or form as cylidrical ingot . 
   + This cylindrical ingot will be slice into disc or wafers . 
   + The wafer is cut (diced) into many pieces, each containing one copy of the circuit. Each of these pieces is called a die.
   
   **2.Photolithography**
   
 + Photolitography is a technique used to pattering silicon wafer  and to protect it desired areas during echting, deposition or ion implantation . 
 + A layer of sensitive checmical called the photoresist is coated on the substrade will be selectively illuminate by the UV light through the photomask . 
 + A photomask is a mask that is constructed with chromium to prevent light to go through during the process . The gap or part that is not covered by the chromium will let the UV light pass through causing the photoresist dissolve and the desired shapep that we desired is implemented .
 + Ething of the layer is done afterwards to formed the pattern desired .

  **3.Well and Channel Formation**
   
  <img width="570" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/211452116-8f012552-2ae0-4c23-b338-6e64dccb493f.png">

   + **N-well / P-well Process** is where the n-type diffusion is done to a p-type subtrade or p-type diffusion is done on a n-type substrate respectively .
   + **The twin well process** is where NMOS and PMOS transitor are developed over the wafer by simulataneous diffusion over an epitaxial growth base rather than a substrate . This will allow the optimization of each transistor type . 
   + **Triple well process** NMOS formed by n+ on p-well, which sits inside a n-well, which further sits on the substrate. PMOS formed by p+ on n-well, which sits on the substrate. This allow a good isolation between analog and digital blocks in mixed signal chips and also to isolate high density dynamic memory from logic .
   
 **4.Silicon Dioxide** (SiO2) 
   
   + The purpose of this process is to create a silicon dioxide layer on top of the silicon surface . Can be done using : 
   
   |Wet Oxidation | Dry Oxidation |
   |---|---|
   |900-1000 Degree Celcius | In the region of 1200 Degree Celcius | 
   |Rapid Process | Form a better quality oxide |
   |Form a thick field layer oxide | Form a thin oxide , highly controlled gate oxide |
   
   + **Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD )** - Another method to deposite the silicon dioxide on top of the subtrate or surface . Think layer of Chemical A is introduce to a surface and chemical B is introduce afterwards to produce a thin layer of the required layer . 
   
   **5.Isolation** 
   
   + solation between two adjacent transistors in CMOS circuits is necessary to isolate n channel and p channel transistors in order to avoid the undesirable parasitic currents between the transistors.
   + Example process of isolation is Local Oxidation of Silicon(LOCOS) or Shallow Trench Isolation (STI)
   + STI is introdued due to some problem with LOCOS process which is the transition between thick and thin layer oxide require some extended so called bird beak .
   
  **6.Gate Oxide**
   
   + One of the common process to form the gate oxide in the transitor .
   + The gate oxide is a layer that seperate the gate termincal of Mosfet from the source and drain terminal as well the conductive channel that connect source and drain when the MOSFET is turned on . 
   
   **7.Gate and Source/Drain Formations**
   
+ Grow gate oxide wherever transistors are required (area = source + drain + gate)––elsewhere there will be thick oxide or trench isolation.
+ Deposit polysilicon on chip
+ Pattern polysilicon (both gates and interconnect)
+ Etch exposed gate oxide—i.e., the area of gate oxide where transistors are required that was not covered by polysilicon; at this stage, the chip has windows down to the well or substrate wherever a source/drain diffusion is required
+ Implant pMOS and nMOS source/drain regions through iom bombartment .

   **8.Contact and Metallization**
   
   + Connections must be made to link the circuits together . This is how the metallization process comes into . So called the interconnects

   <img width="322" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/211474607-c86d1553-b633-43d7-94af-fe755ecd3086.png">
   
   *Metal Deposition is done to link all the trasnsitor together to form a circuit .*
   
   + Other important application of metallization is the top-level metal that provides a connection to the outside world. To reduce interconnection resistance and save area on a chip, multilevel metallization.
   + Metallization is also used to produce rectifying (Schottky barrier) contacts, guard rings, and diffusion barriers between reacting metallic films.
   + [Reference link for metallization ](https://www.circuitstoday.com/metallization-process)

   
   **9.Passivation**
   
   + After metellization process passivation is done afterwards, passivation is a process of where we add the protective glass layer to prevents the ingress of contaminants or to protect the internal semiconductor devices.
   + The overglass cuts which is the opening in the passivation layer is required to allow the connection of the I/O pads and test the probe points . 
   
   **10.Metrology**
   
   + Metrology is basically more to quality assurace methods by calibrate and measure the resulting parts in the procduction process .

 ## Day 3
## Theory - CMOS Fabrication Process in Deep-Submicron (DSM) and Ultra Deep-Submicron (UDSM) Technology 
<details><summary> Introduction to DSM </summary>

### **Overview**

+ As transistor size is getting smaller and smaller , more challanges is introduced  towards fabricating the cmos such as **Hot carrier injection**, **Punch Through Effect**, more noise and many more .This cause the submicron process is not realiable anymore and the Deep-Submicron process is introduced . 
 
+ One disadvatange of the submicron process is during the isolation process , as the transistor getting smaller , the used of reverse bias pn junctions for isolation  becomes impractical .
 
 <img width="454" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/211742121-70977f3e-188a-4db7-8ad8-5b4e4bb303d5.png">

 
+ LOCOS techniqued is used in the isolation process . The limitation of this technique is due to the bird beak effect which extend some distance literally on the transition of the thick and thin oxide . The surface area also is lost due to this enroachment .
 
+ The great things about LOCOS is it **takes a simple process flow**, **High oxide quality procduced** 
 
 <img width="251" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/211741488-56ac5923-5e25-44c9-9e95-b922b475e7dc.png">

 *LOCOS process step *

+ Due to the limitation from the LOCOS , Sallow Trench Isolation (STI) Technology is introduced. 
+ STI allows the closer spacing of transistor which eliminate the depletion region at the surface and the bird's beak effect .
+ STI process able to grow a think layer of oxide compare to LOCOS which create the bird's beak shape .'

 Due to the addition of NMOS and PMOS transitor , DSM provides : 
 
 + A deep n-well that can be used to lower down the substrade noise coupling . 
 + A MOS varactor , that can be utilized as voltage controlled oscillators .
 + Different type of resistor : 
   + Diffused and/or implanted resitor - Diffused resistors are resistors that are fabricated through p-type diffusion into an n-type background and the surface geometry such as the length, width and the diffused impurity profile determine the resistance value . Sheet resistance is the parameter to defining this resistance . 
   + Well resitors - The surface geometry such as the length, width and the diffused impurity profile determine the resistance value . Will give a very high resistance value .
   + Poly Resistor - widely used as an important device in CMOS analog circuit design . Would give a small amout of resitance .
   + Metal Resistor - due to the interconnection of metal . Typicaly has a very small among of resitance by still we can do it as resistor . The thicker the thickness of the metal the lesser the resistance will be . Metal thickness increases as the metal number increase . Ex . metal 1 will be less thicker compared to metal 6.

 Steps for a DSM CMOS process . 
  **1.** p and n wells formation .
  **2.** Shallow trench isolation - Need isolation between nmos and pmos . Used STI instead of LOCOS 
  **3.** Threshold shift and anti punch through implant - doping/implantation that will alter the threshold voltage ( to avoid the punchthrough effect )
  **4.** Thin oxide and gate polysilicon - typicaly putting the gate oxide 
  **5.** Lightly doped drains and sources. - To avoid bad adjacent between the drain and source ( to reduce the depletion region )
  **6.** Sidewall spacer . ( Introduced in DSM to avoid unnesarry extension of source and drain ) 
  **7.** Heavily doped drains and sources 
  **8.** Siliciding ( Salicide and Polycide) - To increase the conductitivy between drain and source by achieving a good ohmic contact . 
  **9.** Bottom metal, tungsten plugs, and oxide - bottom metal = metal 1 , tungsten plug = tungsten contact  
  **10.** Higher level metals, tungsten plugs/vias, and oxide - metal 2,3 
  **11.** Top level metal, vias and protective oxide.

 
   **Starting Material.** 
 + Substrade is highly doped to get a good conductor . 
 
  **1. p and n wells formation.**
  <img width="606" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/211956519-f36b01fe-bb92-4876-b9bf-5f46dfa54197.png">
 
  + photolithography is done as usual to pattern the substrate . 
  + p-well implanct and  Diffusion and n-well implant and Diffusion is done to create the p well and n well respectively. 
  + Diffusion - process of adding impurities atoms from a region with high concentration to a region of low concentration. The dopants or impurity atoms are added to the silicon (semiconductor material), which changes its resistivity. The process of diffusion is highly dependent on the temperature.
  + Implantation - Heavy electric field is used to plan the atom/material . a process of adding dopant to the silicon substrate to enable the conductivity .
  
  **2. Shallow Trench Isolation**
 
  + Electrically isolates one region or transitor from another which prevents electric current leakage between adjacent semiconductor device components .

  + P thershold implant is used balance to the threshold voltage or control the threshold voltage . 
  + implantation also is used to create a highly doped region to avoid the punch through effect . By doing this the depletion region will become more smaller . 
  + Punch through effect is where the depletion region of the source terminal and the depletion region on the drain terminal is meet with each other .
  
  **4. Thin Oxide and Polysilicon Gate**
  
  <img width="591" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/211959978-41c9f5fd-cda0-4777-8c9f-3d94a3520d34.png">

  Same type of process in submicron .
  
  **5. Lightly DOpen Source and Drain**
  
  + Not being done in the submicron process .
  + Lightly dope is being done to control the deplettion region (less), Kinetic energy / Electric field (less) and to avoid the impact ionization .
  + Impact Ionization is where the hot electron impact the drain causing dislodging holes , these holes are swept towards negatively charged substrate causing a current flowing in the subtrate.

  + typically is a Silicon Nitrade .
  + Prevent the drain and source next to the channel from becoming a heavily doped . 
  
  **7. Implantation of Heavily doped source and drain**

  + at the spacer side we can see the heavily doped part is not extending towards the drain  and source near the channel thats helps to reducing the overlap capacitance and impact ionization . 
  + This also helps to able to get a good ohmic contact . 
  
  **8.Siliciding ( Salicide and Polyside) **
  
<img width="591" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/211965246-933e0c72-8030-49de-94af-83d23f9184e2.png">
  
   + To create a good ohmic contact between the contact-drain and contact-source . 
   + polyside helps to reduce the resistance of the poly 
   + Added or used in the Deep submicron process but no in the submicron . 
  
  **9. Intermediate Oxide Layer**
  
  <img width="591" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/211965300-70ce54bd-ccf7-4f1c-82b2-29b5f87f0f95.png"
       
   + Next step will be more on the back end process which where the connection from the drain and source towards the metal/outside . 
   + Oxide layer is used to cover the transitor and to planarize the surface .
   + A hole on the oxide will be done for contact purposes to the outside .
   
   **10 . First level metal**

   + Through via of tungsten contact to connect the device,well and subtrade to the first metal layer . 
   + The tungsten oxide film produced by the target sputtering deposition method has the advantages of high density, good adhesion, and good corrosion resistance, so it is suitable for use in semiconductor chips. Has a good thermal characteristic .
   
   **11. Second Level metal **

  <img width="609" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/211971147-278b6cc3-f5ed-48b3-af0b-052b95374e3d.png">

  + The step 10 is repeated until the top metal layer . 
  + The top metal layer usually is thicker than the first or second metal layer due to the amount of current it need to bring . Usually is related to the power routing or transmission line purposes. The top metal layer also can be used as capacitor or inductor formation .
  + The proctective insulator layer act as a passivation to protect the top metal connection to outside  .
  
  **Summary**
  
  + Able to adress the excessive depletion region in junction isolation . 
  + metal levels is more when getting into the ultra deep submicron technology or getting into deeper technology .
  + Lightly doped helps to avoid impact ionization , junction capacitance hence improving analog performance .

<details><summary> MOS structure </summary>

**MOS STRUCTURE**

+ Typically MOS structure is build base on the name itself which is Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) . Which is the oxide layer will be sandwiched by metal at the top and semiconductor layer on bottom . 
+ Normally the metal itself is the high-conductivity polycrystalline silicon that has been deposited on the oxide . That's is the reason why we call metal due to its conductivity properties such as metal . 
+ Since the oxide is between two conductive layer . We can imagine the structure of a  MOS as capacitor itself . 
+ Due to this we have a C-V Characteristic of a MOS . 
+ Capacitance of metal to metal (MOM) structure is basically is constant - Co
+ For MOS , the capacitance will varied with respect to voltage change . 
+ The capacitance also is affected by the frequency . The relationship is inversely propotional to each other .
+ The flat-band voltage is defined as the applied gate voltage such that there is no band bending in the semiconductor  , as a result, zero net space charge in this region .
+ Due to fermi level of metal and semiconductor and is not balance during zero applied gate bias voltage

*Parameters when ideal case of MOS is used*

+ In Ideal case we neglect all the parameters shown in the picture . The focus on ideal case will be on how it operate during these gate bias (**V<0** , **0<V<VT**, **V >VT**).

**1.Case 1 (V<0)**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/212444928-e826fbf9-a3d9-482b-95e7-c2d50bd785e4.png)

+In this case v < 0 means we applied a reverse gate voltage .
+ This cause the neagtively charge to exist  in the metal plate whereas the positively charge exist in the semiconductor plate .
+ Because of these charges , an Electric field is induced bwtween this two plate causing the majority carrier in the substrate which is hole ( in this case we assume that the subtrate is P-subtrate )  experience a force toward the oxide– semiconductor interface .
+ This causes the accumulation of holes at the interface . 
 
**2.Case 2 (0<V<Vt)**

<img width="460" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/212447302-25d27d92-dda2-4f3a-a468-1bcbdea9cb68.png">

+ As we applied a positive bias ,  The metal plate will become positively charge where as the semiconductor plate will be more likely to be negatively chrage . 
+ The induced electric field will push or force away the majority caarrier which is hole from the interface .
+ This will induced the space charge region which mainly consist of negatively charge ion due to fact that p substrate is a acceptor atoms .
+ At a certain voltage point where the surface carrier concentration is the same as the bulk carrier concentration is called the weak inversion voltage or threshold voltage . This is the point where the inversion point started . Where p-type becoming more like a n type semiconductor . 
+ Inversion here means that since the substrate is a p type subtrate . The majority carrier is hold . But applying the positive bias gate voltage cause the holes at the subtrate is being filled with electrons and becomes negatively charge . This cause the carrier concentration of the bulk which is hole at the p-substrate is becoming less compared to the induced space charge region as it being filled with electrons . therefoe only near the interface of the oxide-semiconductor , the p-type inverted to the n-type . 
+ Energy band diagram with respect to positive gate voltage is shown below.

 + A channel is form at the threshold voltage . 
 + If we apply a large positive gate voltage , basically what will happen that the induced space charge region will become much larger/bigger in magnitude means more negatively charge .
 + The surface in the semiconductor adjacent to the oxide–semiconductor interface is becoming more n type . Inversion occurs .
 + This leads to more band bending . 

 <img width="282" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/212446546-a6b847ea-944a-44c5-937a-3a7cb8d65d54.png">
 
+ The conduction band close to the Fermi level, whereas the valence band is close to the Fermi level in the bulk semiconductor . 
+ Meaning at the oxide-semiconductor interface inversion happen form p type to n-type.

 + In non ideal MOS structure some of the parameters/concept will take into account such as the Effect of fixed Charge (Qf) 
 + Fixed charge is basically charge that is being traped on the oxide layer . This will attract the negative charge to the oxide-semiconducter interface . Creating a negarive potential eventhough it is zero applied gate voltage.  
 + This is due to the imperfection of the fabrication process during the silicon dioxide deposition . At the interface might have some Silicon hydroxide and other chemical .  
 + To balance this voltage a negative voltage is required so that the surface charge at the silicon will be zero . 
 
 + Another effect that can be take into account when deal with non ideal MOS is the effect of the work metal-semiconductor work function difference .
 + In ideal case the work function difference is assume to be 0 but in real case or non ideal case it is difference .
 + Because the fermi energy level are difference between metal and semiconductor and the fermi level also is depends on doping . 
 + Since typically the evergy of the metal is higher than the semiconductor ( Means the fermi level is higher ) the electrons will be transfer to the semiconductor side .
 + This cause the semiconductor to be more like a n-type since it receive electron from the metal .
 + Also the conduction band near the interface also will bend due to this electron recieved .
 + Due to this effect . There is some voltage or potential eventhough when zero gate voltage is applied .

 **N Channel Enchancement**
 
 + As the name goes enchancement , the channel is enchance or form through a positive gate voltage as we discuss in the MOS structure chapter(Day4). The induced space charge region is form. 
 + A positive gate voltage induces the electron inversion layer, which then “connects” the n-type source and the n-type drain regions. 
 + The source terminal is the source of carriers that flow through the channel to the drain terminal
 + Meaning that the electron will flow from source to drain and current will be flow vice versa .

<img width="452" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/212854257-1524ae97-0adc-491b-846c-f8ee324267f7.png">

 *N channel enchancement mode MOSFET operation*

 + When Vgs is less than the threshold voltage . No channel will be form and no drain current will be flow . We call this as cut off operation . (Ideally)
 + When Vgs is greather than the threshold voltage .  An electron inversion layer has been created so that when a small drain voltage is applied, the electrons in the inversion layer will flow from the source to the positive drain terminal. ( Linear region ) 
 + The conventional current enters the drain terminal and leaves the source  terminal.

 *The n-channel enhancement mode MOSFET with an applied gate voltage VGS<VT and with VGS>VT.*
 
+ When the VDS value increases. The voltage drop across the oxide near the drain terminal decreases, which means that the induced inversion charge density near the drain also decreases . ( Still linear region ) (Vgs-vt < Vds) 
+ When VDS increases to the point where the potential drop across the oxide at the drain terminal is equal to VT, the induced inversion charge density is zero at the drain terminal . The VDS at this point is called VDS(sat) ( Vgs-Vt = Vds ) (Vds = Vdsat)
+ When VDS becomes larger than the VDS (sat) value, the point in the channel at which the inversion charge is just zero moves toward the source terminal. 
+ In this case, electrons enter the channel at the source, travel through the channel toward the drain, and then, at the point where the charge goes to zero, the electrons are injected into the space charge region where they are swept by the E-field to the drain contact .
+ At this point then the drain current will be a constant ( Act as constant current source). We call it as saturation region .
+ Id is not depend on VDS anymore .

  + In Ideal case the subtrate and source terminal is connected to ground .
  + In real case the substrate and source may not have the some potential .
  + Therefore to achieve the same potential , source-to-substrate pn junction must always be zero or reverse biased, 
  + So VSB must always be greater than or equal to zero.
  + Same concept as the flat band voltage to achieve balance voltage due to the non ideal effect. 
  + Why VSB ? Why not VBS ? - Since the substrate is p type and the source is n type , if we applied a VBS , it will be a diode since it is foward bias . Meaning that there is a current flow from the subtrate to source . 
 
 + The space charge region width under the oxide increases from the original value when Vsb is applied. 
 + With an applied VSB>0, there is more charge associated with this region. Qd is increasing . Surface potential Fi(s) also will increases .
 + The positive charge on the top metal gate must increase to compensate for the increased negative space charge in order to reach the threshold inversion point. So when VSB>0, the threshold voltage of the n-channel MOSFET increases .

 + In Ideal case we assume that the current and channel Length is constant . But in real case it is change due to channel length modulation effect. 
 + When the applying the VDS voltage until the VDS > VDS(sat) the transistor operate in saturation region . 
 + The depletion region at the drain terminal extends laterally into the channel, reducing the effective channel length .
 +  some typical ID versus VDS curves with positive slopes in the saturation region due to channel length modulation . 
 + Vds increase L will be decrease and current will be increase .

 **Voltage**
+ Across PVT the threshold voltage as will get affected .
+ Threshold voltage depends on voltage across oxide + voltage accross depletion region 
+ voltage across oxide depends on thickness on the oxide . 
+ Voltage across depletion region depedns on the doping concentration p-substrate  and depletion volt .
 
 **Fabrication**
 
+ For imperfection farbication process of oxide , the thickness of the oxide itself may be varied.
+ The greather the thickness of the oxide the higher will be the threshold Voltage .
+ As substrate doping increases , threshold voltage increases as well .
+ q=CV q = 2qEsiNaFi(t)
 
**Temperature**
 
 + Mobility decrease as temperature increase . the carrier does not move smoothly.
 + As temperature increase the thershold voltage also increase .

  + is like a  natural capacitance existense in the MOSFET itself . 
  + When two electrical conductors at different voltages are close together, the electric field between them causes electric charge to be stored on them; this effect is capacitance.

  *Intrinsic Capacitance During Cut Off region*
  
 + Depletion region  is formed due as the PN junction between the P from subtrate and N from the drain are given a bias which is Vds . This configuration act as reverse bias . 
 + Due to this depletion region . A capacitance is formed between the drain and bulk . We called it as junction capacitance or depletion capacitance . 
 + This junction/depletion capacitance depends on the Vds voltage and the distance between the depletion region itself . 
 + This concepet also can be apply on the Csb but the depletion region on source is much smaller or lesser as it does not control by any voltage .
 + The overlap/extension  of the source and drain under the gate create a capacitance as well . We called it as the overlap capacitance . 
 +  Cgb is capacitance formed between the poly and the bulk .

  *Intrinsic Capacitance During Linear region*
  
  +  The vds increase to get into the linear region , means that the depletion region on the source also increase causing the cdb to decrease . 
  +  Overlap capacitance remain constant as it is depends on the fabrication process .
  +  Difference is the existense of the cgsdch and cch-b

 + CMOS inverter is the most basic (nucleolus) of all digital design. ( concept can be apply to the other gate as well)
 + Due to its popularness in the digital design understanding the characteristic(static and drynamic) of cmos inverter would be a good benefical to us . 
 + In this case , we would analyze the cmos inveter aspect interm of **cost**, **Integrity and Robustness**, **Performance** and **Energy Efficiency** .
 
 + Cost - depends on complextity and area 
 + Integrity and Robustness - Depend on the static behaviour (leakage) . Ideally static current is 0 but in real case not 0 . 
 + Performance -  Performance related to freqeuncy . Also related to the dynamic responce .
 + Energy Efficiency - The higher the freqeuncy the higher will be the power consumption. swtiching/transiton , leakage related  . 
 
  </details>
  
 <details><summary> Static Characteristic </summary>
 
<img width="512" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/214774947-a2d8acba-af63-4b9a-92b6-ade94798988e.png">

 
+ Act as a switch . Practically there is an finite on resistance when the transitor is on and infinite off resistance when the transitor is off . Ideally would be 0 . 
+ Input 1 Output 0 (NMOS will turn on and the output will pull to the GND)
+ if Input 0 Output would be 1 (PMOS will turn on and the output will put to VDD)

 + Rail to rail means always VDD or GND cannot be at the middle . Like peak to peak . Results in high noise margin .
 + It is independent to the size or rationless. Means it always 1 or 0 . 
 + Other technology such as NMOS technology would depend on size to get certain voltage . 
 + This means very small size of CMOS inverter would give VDD/GND .
 + This helps to reduce area and cost . 
 + there is always a finite resistance between the output and vdd or ground means rn or rp . causing it to be low output impedance .
 + The output impedance refers to the impedance, or opposition to current flow, of the component that often bears an electrical source to "drive" a load component .
 + means it is less sensitive to noise .
 + Imput impedance almost infinity meaning that no current flow and able to drive multiple or inifinite number of gate .
 + By driving multuple gate fanout capacitance will increase the propagation delay . 
 + Static power almost 0 means that there is very small current flowing from VDD to the GND .

 *Voltage Transfer Characteristic*
 
 + At the symmertical point , the resitance of rn and rp is the same . 
 + typicaly to get symmetrical , PMOS size is usually 2.5 to 3 size of NMOS .

 *MOSFET Strength Variation*
 
 + Strength is related to the W of the Nmos and PMOS 
 + Strong means the W is larger while weak means the Width is smaller
 + Width is propotional to the current . Means more width more current and more conductive .
 + Ex . Strong NMOS means we increase the conductivity of the NMOS , means that the Nmos resistance will be decrease so that use less voltage to conduct . So the graph will shift to left .
 + Ex. Strong nmos will pull the graph to the right as it required more voltage to conduct .

 *Noise Margin CMOS inverter*
 
 + Noise Margin - How much noise can the inverter tolerate . 
 + VIH - Minimum input voltage so that the VOH is low . or consider as the minimum input voltage so that the inverter recognized the input voltage as 1 
 + VIL - Maximum input voltage so that the VIH is high . or consider as the maximum input voltage so that the inverter recognized the input voltage as 0 .
 + VOH - The maixumum output voltage so that the inverter recognized the voltage as logic 1 .
 + VOL - The minumum output voltage so that the inverter recognized the voltage as logic 0 . 
 + Less noise margin means the inverter is more sensitive to noise .
 + more noise margin means the inveter is less sensitive to noise .

 + Dyanmic is more related to time while static means more to steady state .
 + The CL is very crutial as it will affect the propagation delay , and rise/fall time of the inverter .
 + The finite resistance Rn and Rp plus the CL will give the responce to the delay .

 + The CL is consist of 

  **Instrinsic Capacitance** - Capacitance inside the cmos which is the junction capacitance .
  **Wiring Capacitance** - Capactiance due to the metal routing, interconnect .
  **Fanout Capacitance** - Capactiance due to the gate capacitance of next device or gate . 
 
 + The capacitance due to the wiring depends upon the length and width of the connecting wires, and is a function of the distance of the fanout from the driving gate and the number of fanout gates

 *Rise Time Defination* Capactior need times to charge , not suddenly charging.

 *Propatgation Delay Defination* 
 
 + Hence, a fast gate is built either by keeping the output capacitance small or by decreasing the on-resistance of the transistor.
 + Aware that the on-resistance of the NMOS and PMOS transistor is not constant, but is a nonlinear function of the voltage across the transistor.
 + propagation delay of the CMOS inverter is determined by the time it takes to charge and discharge the load capacitor CL  through the PMOS and NMOS transistors

 + layout helps to reduce the diffusion and interconnect capacitances .
 + This flexibility allows the designer to trade-off energy dissipation for performance .
 + Also, reliability concerns (oxide breakdown, hot-electron effects) enforce firm upper-bounds on the supply voltage in deep sub-micron processes.

 + The finite slope of the input signal causes a direct current path between VDD and GND for a short period of time during switching, while the NMOS and the PMOS
transistors are conducting simultaneously .
 + peak current is also a strong function of the ratio between input and output slopes
 + short-circuit dissipation is minimized by making the output rise/fall time larger than the input rise/fall time .
 + making the output rise/fall time too large slows down the circuit and can cause short-circuit currents in the fan-out gates

*vt calculation and finding kn*

+ Vsb = 0 
+ Vds and Vgs always the same to get saturation operation .
+ If the square root of the measured drain current values is plotted against the gate-tosource voltage, the slope and the voltage-axis intercept of the resulting curve(s) can determine the parameters kn, VT0 and y.
+ By extrapolating
+ the curves to zero-drain-current (voltage-axis intercept point), we can find the threshold voltage VT that corresponds to each VSB value.
The slope of each
+ curve is equal to the square root of (kn/2). Thus, the transconductance parameter k, can simply be calculated from this slope

+ Next, consider the extrapolated threshold voltage values, obtained from voltage axis intercepts at nonzero substrate bias voltage. Using one of the available VSB values, the substrate bias coefficient can be found from the equation as in the snapshot.

+ The reduction of the size, i.e., the dimensions of MOSFETs, is commonly referred to as scaling
+ There are two basic types of size-reduction strategies: full scaling (also called constant-field scaling) and constant voltage scaling

 **Constant Field Scaling**
 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/215931530-9e4b6253-b187-4884-87f6-1eefba7a1538.png)

+  This significant reduction of the power dissipation is one of the most attractive features of full scaling

**Constant Voltage Scaling**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/215932510-9525b0e5-597c-42d8-b6ad-bb2878ad1f84.png)

+ Scaling down the voltage supply not practical  which in turn would necessitate multiple power supply voltages and complicated levelshifter arrangements.
+  The doping densities must be increased by a factor of s2 in order to preserve the charge-field relations.
+  the saturation-mode drain current will be increased by a factor of S after constant voltage scaling. 
+ the power density (power dissipation per unit area) is found to increase by a factor of S3 after constant-voltage scaling.

+ constant-voltage scaling may be preferred over full (constant-field) scaling in many practical cases because of the external voltage-level constraints. 
+ It must be recognized, however, that constant-voltage scaling increases the drain current densityand the power density by a factor of S3. 
+ This large increase in current and power densities may eventually cause serious reliability problems for the scaled transistor, such as electromigration, hot-carrier degradation, oxide breakdown, and electrical over-stress.

+ One of the reason why there is the subthreshol current means not only due to weak inversion only. 
+ Normally the Vgs is the one controlling the barrier . Means if Vgs < Vto , the carriers (electrons) in the channel face a potential barrier that blocks the flow .
+ the carriers (electrons) in the channel face a potential barrier that blocks the flow
+ But in small geometry or small size transistor this is not true . Because the the potential barrier is controlled by both the gate-to-source voltage VGS and the drainto-source voltage VDS
+ As the Vds is increasing the potential barrier near the drain is decreasing . This effect is called the DIBL .
+ The reduction of the potential barrier eventually allows electron flow between the source and the drain, even if the gate-to-source voltage is lower than the threshold voltage. (Subthreshold current)

**Mobility Degradation**

+ At a certain Electric field the carrier will experience a velocity saturation. 
+ Carrier velocity saturation actually reduces the saturation-mode current below the current value predicted by the  conventional long-channel current equations.

**Impact Ionization**

+ normally, most of the electrons are attracted by the drain, while the holes enter the substrate to form part of the parasitic substrate current

+ Electrons and holes gaining high kinetic energies in the electric field (hot carriers) may, however, be injected into the gate oxide, and cause permanent changes in the oxideinterface charge distribution, degrading the current-voltage characteristics of the MOSFET

+ Combinational logic circuits, or gates, which the outputs is determine from the  Boolean functions of the inputs.
+ Different from sequential , Output is depends on the current input data abut also previous state or values of the inputs signal. 
+ This is done by providing a feedback of the output to the input signal . 
+ Consequently, the circuit “remembers” past events and has a sense of history.
+ A sequential circuit includes a combinational logic portion and a module that holds the state. 
+ Example circuits are registers, counters, oscillators, and memory.
+ Static CMOS is used due to its advantages ,(i.e, low sensitivity to noise), good performance, and low power consumption with no static power dissipation
+ Combinational logic gates is the combinatation of transitor/gate to perform some boolean expression to get the desired output .

*Five basic characteristic when using CMOS technology*

+ An NMOS device pulls the output all the way down to GND, while a PMOS lowers the output no further than |VTp| — the PMOS turns off at that point, and stops contributing discharge current . 
+ For pmos Vsg need to be greather than vt . So as the output discharge to the ground . Vsg will drop and evetually be less than Vt . causing it to be off .
+ A PMOS switch succeeds in charging the output all the way to VDD, while the NMOS device fails to raise the output above
VDD-VTn.
+ This is because when the nmos become pup . the output will be charging towards vdd . So at one point , Vgs will becomes less than vt causing the nmos to off .

+ This means that a parallel connection of transistors in the pull-up network corresponds to a series connection of the corresponding devices in the pull-down .
+ Naturally inverting gate such as NAND,NOR and XNOR .

*VTC for NAND gates*

+ The large variation between case (a) and the others (b & c) is explained by the fact that in the former case both transistors in the pull-up network are on simultaneously for A=B=0 representing a strong pull-up . 
+  In the latter cases, only one of the pullup devices is on. The VTC is shifted to the left as a result of the weaker PUN.
+ The difference between (b) and (c) results mainly from the state of the internal node int between the two NMOS devices
+ For the NMOS devices to turn on, both gate-to source voltages must be above VTn, with VGS2 = VA - VDS1 and VGS1 = VB. 
+ The threshold For case (b), M3  is turned off, and the gate voltage of M2 is set to VDD.
+ To a first order, M2  may be considered as a resistor in series with M1.
+ Since the drive on M2  is large, this resistance is small and has only a small effect on the voltage transfer characteristics
+ In case (c), transistor M1 acts as a resistor, causing body effect in M2. The overall impact is quite small as seen from the plot.
+ In here basically means the vih vil vol voh is very important as the input and output will change base on different snenario. 

**Propagation Delay**

 + As expected, the case where both inputs transition go low (A = B = 1-->0) results in a smaller delay, compared to the case where only one input is driven low. 
+ Notice that the worst-case low-to-high delay depends upon which input (A or B) goes low. 
+ The reason for this involves the internal node capacitance of the pull-down stack (i.e., the source of M2
). 
+ For the case that B = 1 and A transitions from 1->0, the pull-up PMOS device only has to charge up the output node capacitance since M2 is turned off. 
+ On the other hand, for the case where A=1 and B transitions from 1->0, the pull-up PMOS device has to charge up the sum of the output and the internal node capacitances, which slows down the transition.

 *NAND VS NOR Comparison*
 
 + From the above discussion we found that to get the same delay as the inverter NOR implementation required more area compared to NAND implementation. 
 + So we conclude NAND implementation is preferred over NOR implementation.
 + In other words, adding devices in series slows down the circuit, and devices must be made wider to avoid a performance penalty.
 +  Since PMOS devices have a lower mobility relative to NMOS devices, stacking devices in series must be avoided as much as possible

 + Most widely-used solution to deal with the voltage-drop problem is the use of transmission gates. 
 + NMOS devices pass a strong 0 but a weak 1, while PMOS transistors pass a strong 1 but a weak 0. 
 + The ideal approach is to use an NMOS to pull-down and a PMOS to pull-up. 
 + The control signals to the transmission gate (C and C) are complementary. 
 + The transmission gate acts as a bidirectional switch controlled by the gate signal C. 
 + When C = 1, both MOSFETs are on, allowing the signal to pass through the gate.
 +  C = 0 places both transistors in cutoff, creating an open circuit between nodes A and B.

 + Consider the case of charging node Vout to VDD for the transmission gate . 
 + Vin is driven to VDD and transmission gate is enabled (C = 1 and C= 0).
 + If only the NMOS pass-device were present, Vout charges up to VDD-VTn at which point the NMOS device turns off. 
 + Because the source of the nmos is increasing as vout charing up to vdd , causing the Vgs will become lesses and lesser and eventually less than vt causing it to be off .
 + However, since the PMOS device is present and turned on (VGSp = -VDD), charging continues all the way up to VDD. 
 + On other hand, discharging Vout to 0. Vout is initially at VDD when Vin is driven low.
 + The PMOS transistor by itself can only pull down vout to VTp at which point it turns off. 
 + The parallel NMOS device however stays turned on (since its VGS = VDD) and pulls vout all the way to GND. 
 +Though the transmission gate requires two transistors and more control signals, it enables rail-to-rail swing.

+ Combinational logic circuits that were described earlier have the property that the output of a logic block is only a function of the current input values
+  Systems require storage of state information, leading to another class of circuits calledsequential logic circuits
+  In these circuits, the output not only depends upon the current values of the inputs, but also upon preceding input values
+ synchronous sequential systems - in which all registers are under control of asingle global clock.
+ The Next State is determined based on the Current State and the current Inputs and is fed to the inputs of registers
+ registers can be positive edge-triggered (where the input data is updated on the positive edge) or negative edge-triggered (where the input data is updated on the negative edge of the clock, as is indicated by a small circle at the clock input). 

 **Bistable Principle**
 
<img width="576" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/218962696-db002725-fa4b-4846-8c69-17a59c1a9450.png">

+ Static memories use positive feedback to create a bistable circuit 
+ a bistable circuit — a circuit having two stable states that represent 0 and 1
+ The chance is indeed very small that the cross-coupled inverter pair is biased at C and stays there. 
+ Operation points with this property are termed metastable.
+ The circuit serves as amemory, storing either a 1 or a 0 depending on to position A and B .
+ A trigger pulse must be applied to change the state of the circuit.

+  SR — or set-reset.
+ This circuit is similar to the cross-coupled inverter pairwith NOR gates replacing the inverters
+ The second input of the NOR gates is connected to the trigger inputs (S and R), that make it possible to force the outputs Q and Q' to a given state .
+ 1 on S will Set means Q=1 meanwhile 1 on R will reset means Q=0
+ For NAND based it is inverted as the input is active low . means that when S=0 it is set(Q=1) and R=0 it is reset(Q=0) .
+ When S and R 1 it is invalid as it is not compliment each other .
+  asynchronous - do not require a clock signal.

**Clocked SR latch**

+ Known also as SR flip-flop— a level-sensitive positive latch.
+ It will update the output when the clk is 1 for NOR based
+ For Nand base it will update when the clk is 0. 
+ For NOR is AOI

**NAND Based Clocked SR Latch with Active HIGH Inputs**

+ Using NAND based but the output will get updated when the clk is 1 .
+ Output is 1 when S=1 and output is 0 when R=1 .
+ " The drawback of this implementation is that the transistor count is higher than the active low version

**JK Latch**

+ when both inputs S and R are activated at the same time , 
+ This problem can be overcome by adding two feedback lines from the outputs to the inputs. know as JK latch.
+ both inputs are equal to " 1 " during the active clock phase, the latch simply switches its state due to feedback.

+  The output levels of the flip-flop circuit are determined during this second phase, based on the master-stage outputs set in the previous phase.
+ the circuit is never transparent, i.e., a change occurring in the primary inputs is never reflected directly to the outputs.
+ Due to only one circuit can be active on a time.
+ clearly advantages that separates the master-slave flip-flop from all of the latch circuits .
+ When the clock pulse is high, a narrow spike or glitch in one of the inputs, 
+ for instance a glitch in the J line (or K line), may set (or reset) the master latch and thus cause an unwanted state transition, which will then be propagated into the slave stage during the following phase.
+ Can be eliminated with the edge triggered flip flop .

*Operation of D-FF*

+ When the clock is, high, the master stage follows the D input while the slave stage holds the previous value.
+ When the clock changes from logic "1" to logic 0 "," the master latch ceases to sample the input and stores the D value at the time of the clock transition.
+ At the same time, the slave latch becomes transparent, passing the stored master value to the output of the slave stage, Q.
+ The input cannot affect the output because the master stage is disconnected from the D input
+ When the clock changes again from logic 0" to 1," the slave latch locks in the master latch output and the master stage starts sampling the input again.
+ this circuit is a negative edge-triggered D flip-flop by virtue of the fact that it samples the input at the falling edge of the clock pulse.

+ When input is from 0 to Vdd .
+ When input is 0 . Nmos if off .(Region1)
+ V0 is equal to vdd . causing the N2 to turn on also passing Vdd to Vx in saturation region. 
+ But slowly increasing the input from 0 . 
+ N0 will turn on in saturation region . meanwhile the N1 is cutoff and N2 is still in saturation region . (Region 2)
+ Since Vx(Vdd during this time) is higher than the input V1 (Slowly increasing from 0) . N1 is in cutoff region.
+ There is still no path from the output/vdd  to the gnd .
+ Output still stay high . 
 
+ If we increase more voltage on the input . (Region 3) 
+ Vx node will decrease and V1 increase . 
+ Causing the Vgs for n1 increase . 
+ At one point it will turn on in saturation region .

+ When input is from Vdd to 0 .
+ When the input is vdd , the output is 0 . (Region 4)
+ PMOS P0 and P1 is off . P2 is in saturation .
+ As we decrease the input from vdd slowly . (Region 5)

+ Vy will increase as current flow from Vdd --> P0 --> P2 . as P1 is off .
+ As Vy is slowly increasing . At one point will cause the P1 to turn on also .
+ Because Vsg1>vt1 . So output will charge to vdd .
+ To turn the output from 0 to 1 . It take much time/voltage compare to normal inverter .
+ Difference between vthl and vthl is hysterysis voltage .which is depends on the width / strength of the transitor .

## Theory - Current Mirror

<details><summary> Introduction </summary>

+ commonly used to replicate current from one branch of the circuit to another, but it can also be used as a biasing network or as a “pseudo” current source
+ M1 and M2 are MOSFETs with same area process, and VGS, IREF is the current we are trying to mirror and Iout is the mirrored current.
+ Since the gate of M1 and M2 are shorted, both MOSFETs experience the same Vov, VGS-VTH
+ Operation of current mirrors is based on the governing equation of MOSFET current in saturation
+ Based on the Id,sat, one can see that the current is modeled by the square of overdrive voltage, VOV = VGS – VTH.
+ same process and overdrive voltage
+ the current flowing through the
+ MOSFETs should be equivalent if they have the same width and length 
+ assuming negligible channel length modulation
+ Some non-idealities such as process variation, VDS difference, and VTH mismatchmay cause current mismatches. 
+ Mismatches in current mirror topology is referred to as the current difference between the reference current, IREF and the output current, IOUT
+  causes of current mismatches can be summarized into the following three categories: Process Variation, threshold voltage mismatches
(Vth), and drain to source voltage difference (VDS).


</details>

<details><summary> Factor of current mismatch </summary>

**Process Variations**

+ mismatch in geometry of each MOSFETs.
+ Due to limitation of certain process .
+ The design geometry might be different than the actual thing.
+ The oxide thickness, width, and length of each MOSFET varies from ie to die and wafer to wafer

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/223716068-e66dd9dd-8b1f-412c-a1e5-1f09f12bf3f3.png)

**Threshold Voltage Difference**

+ A change in VTH directly impact how saturated the devices.
+ This difference in threshold voltage is a result of body effect and non-idealities in doping concentration on the substrate and wells.
+ In addition to intrinsic parameter, a variation in threshold voltage can also be realized as difference in effective VGS.
+ VGS may differ for each device with the presence of parasitic resistance along the interconnects .

**Drain to Source voltage Difference**

+ Ideally, VDS does not have an impact on device biasing point; however, due to channel length modulation.
+ The drain current IDS varies with change in drain to source voltage across the device
+ This phenomenon is observed often in short channel devices and becomes more obvious as the as channel length goes under 180nm

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121993910/223719387-c3bdfa19-a2a3-4ce6-ad16-19c0d13f1732.png)
 
+ To reduce the VDS variation, the designer can choose a longer length for the device.
+ Another technique is to implement a cascoded current mirror . 
+ By having a cascode, the VDS of Q2 will follow VDS of Q1, so the current mirror will significantly reduce the VDS difference between Q1 and Q2.
+ if voltage at D2 were to increase causing an increase in the output current IO, the VGS of Q4 will reduce limiting the current that Q2 is trying to increase.
+ This way IO will be kept very close to the Iref in a small feedback loop.
+ In addition, a cascoded device has high output impedance ~gm4ro4ro2making the mirror current acting more like an ideal current source.
+ One downside of cascoded device is the voltage headroom .
+ In order for Q4 and Q2 to be in saturation, the output voltage must be at least 2VGS – VTH or 2VDS,SAT + VTH.
+ As a rule of thumb in cascode mirrors, it As the best to size Q2 and Q1 as long channels.

<details><summary> Application </summary>

**Scale W2/W1 to save power**

+ In typical current mirror design, W2/W1 are not always 1:1
+ Since the gate voltage of diode-tied (Gate tied to drain) MOSFET is biased with IREF
+ this will create a voltage level for the output branch to mirror and the ratio W2/W1 can be easily changed to save power
+ For example, if the required IOUT is 5 mA, instead of also driving the reference branch with IREF = 5 mA.
+ we can simply reduce IREF to 1 mA and change the W2/W1 ratio to 5:1 while keeping the length identical.
+ This way IOUT is 5 mA with IREF only to be 1 mA to save power on the reference branch, and vice versa if you want a smaller IOUT
+ however, as the ratio increases, the mismatch also increases. Typically a mirror ratio <10 is generally acceptable.

**Distribute Mirror reference current to multiple output branches**

+ A single reference branch can also be used to mirror multiple branches as the circuit may need
+ the mirrored branch can be used to mirror more branches
+ However, do note that the more you mirror, the greater the error may show in current matching.

<details><summary>  PMOS Current Mirror </summary>

+ PMOS can also be used for mirroring
+ The only structure difference between PMOS mirroring and NMOS mirroring is the placement of IREF, to source current or sink current.

+ Small signal model of the mosfet is useful when the mosfet is used as an amplifier 
+ Transconductance(gm) - The MOSFET transconductance is the ratio of change in the drain current to the change in the voltage Vgs. (Gate to Source Voltage) 
+ for the given change in the gate to source voltage, what is the change in the drain current.
+ More changes in Vgs will give more change in Id . gm =d(Id)/d(Vgs)
+ To be as an amplifer the mosfet need to be in saturation region act as a voltage control current source .
+ This is due to the Id is a function of Vgs .

*Small signal model for the Mosfet as amplifier*

+ Rds in this case is neglected as it is very high . Can also be included in the model which will be parallel with the R .
+ Due to the R , the gain obtain is quite small . 
+ Therefore, can replace the resistance to mosfet to get better resistance and improved the gain .
+ Using less transitor aslo can reduce the area .
+ Therefore the Rout will become Rds || Rds .
